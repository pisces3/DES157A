            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-02-05">February 5, 2023</time>
            <h3>Original article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a></h3>
            <p>
                Reading this article made me realize that it’s mainly called modals; I’ve been calling these things popup boxes. This article really helped me a lot identifying when it’s appropriate to use a modal, what should be included in it and how can I effectively show it. The “anatomy of a modal window” that they provided was really helpful as it shows how to effectively create and format a model to maximize positive user experience. Also, I didn’t know that it’s important to give users different options to close/cancel a modal like clicking outside the window or the escape key. I will definitely include this important aspect from now on.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect that I learned from this article is how modals should be triggered by the users. There should be some action that the user did to initiate the modal. I realized that I hate when I go to a website and then a modal would just popup even if I didn’t click anything; I end up not reading the text and just clicking whatever to close the modal (I panic because I always think it’s a virus). 
            </p>
            <p>
                From now on, I will also always try to include accessibility when creating modals especially keyboard accessibility.

            <h2>Learning Best Practices of Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-01-31">January 31, 2022</time>
            <h3>Original article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a></h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about the best design practices when designing forms and this will ultimately help me when designing my MadLibs project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think some of the most important takeaways from this article are positioning the label above the input field (or to the left if it has a bigger viewport), providing placeholder text right below the field, adjusting the size of the fields accordingly and chunking huge forms to multiple steps to reduce cognitive load. The article also emphasized the importance of one column layout as it doesn’t ruin the flow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA</a> redesigned their form. I personally disliked the previous design since it was painstakingly long and slow and just annoying in general. In the redesigned version, FAFSA opted for multiple steps providing a progress bar on the top that indicates how far along the user is and within each step, there’s only 3-5 questions provided. In this way, I had a better user experience filling out forms.
