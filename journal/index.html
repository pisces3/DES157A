            <h2>Learning Best Practices of Form Design</h2>
            <h3>Original article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a></h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about the best design practices when designing forms and this will ultimately help me when designing my MadLibs project. Before reading this article, I wasn’t really sure where to place the label or how big the form fields should be or any other good practices that would enhance user experience.

                I think some of the most important takeaways from this article are positioning the label above the input field (or to the left if it has a bigger viewport), providing placeholder text right below the field, adjusting the size of the fields accordingly and chunking huge forms to multiple steps to reduce cognitive load. The article also emphasized the importance of one column layout as it doesn’t ruin the flow.

                Recently, <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA</a> redesigned their form. I personally disliked the previous design since it was painstakingly long and slow and just annoying in general. In the redesigned version, FAFSA opted for multiple steps providing a progress bar on the top that indicates how far along the user is and within each step, there’s only 3-5 questions provided. In this way, I had a better user experience filling out forms.
