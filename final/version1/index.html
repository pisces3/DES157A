                        This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.

                        Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.

                        This top is perfect for the summer! It’s one of my favorite tops and I always pair it with high waisted wide leg jeans or colorful pants like this one! I had a phase where I would just buy square neck puff sleeve tops because I think they fit me very well.

                        This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.

                        Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.

                        This was very first purchase on the ASOS website. I bought it for $24. This was one of those impulsive online shopping purchases. I convinced my dad to buy this for me because there was free shipping and at that time, ASOS rarely does free shipping.

                        This top is perfect for the summer! It’s one of my favorite tops and I always pair it with high waisted wide leg jeans or colorful pants like this one! I had a phase where I would just buy square neck puff sleeve tops because I think they fit me very well.

                        I still wear this pants today and still one of my faves. They’re really comfy and suit with everything. If I’m feeling more a summer vibe, I would pair it with puff shoulder light colored tops. If I’m feeling a little cool, I would pair it with a black turtleneck and leather jacket.
