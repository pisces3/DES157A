                            We took this during the Labor Day weekend back in 2019 when we and a couple of family friends decided to have a weekend getaway around San Jose/San Francisco. We toured outside a couple of tech companies such as Instagram, Facebook, Google. We also went to the San Jose Garden, Santa Cruz Beach and here at Stanford University. I had so much fun that day and took thousands of pictures! I loveeed the campus so much! It's so pretty and the sun was glowing I was obsessed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hands down, this is one of my favorite summer outfits of all time! As you can see, I had a lot of yellow statement pieces so you can probably conclude that I was already obsessed with yellow by then.

                            I actually do not rememeber the time I bought this top but I just know I bought it at the big Walmart. In the recent years, Walmart has some really good and trendy clothes! It fits my body nicely and it's cotton so it's really comfy too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think this top is very versatile! It can be worn during the summer with your favorite pair of jeans. You can also pair it with a nice pastel skirt around the beach. If you want to look more professional, you can pair it with neutral slacks and I personally like to add an oversized blazer.

                            When I was first building my wardrobe, I would always shop at Forever 21 because they have cheap and trendy clothes. I bought this at the Forever 21 right next to Old Teahouse at the University Mall (RIP F21, you will be missed). I remember the store they had over there was soo big that I think one whole room was just shoes and accessories. I love shopping there because it’s so close to home and there was not a lot of people.

                            I still wear this pants today and still one of my faves. They’re really comfy and suit with everything. If I’m feeling more a summer vibe, I would pair it with puff shoulder light colored tops. If I’m feeling a little cool, I would pair it with a black turtleneck and leather jacket.

                            This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.

                            This was very first purchase on the ASOS website. I bought it for $24. This was one of those impulsive online shopping purchases. I convinced my dad to buy this for me because there was free shipping and at that time, ASOS rarely does free shipping.

                            This top is perfect for the summer! It’s one of my favorite tops and I always pair it with high waisted wide leg jeans or colorful pants like this one! I had a phase where I would just buy square neck puff sleeve tops because I think they fit me very well.

                            This was taken the day after my 18th birthday. FUN FACT! When I was taking this picture with my silly little phone, little did I know, a group of people were already STEALING MY THINGS that had my iPad with my school notes and other valuable stuff! We were only gone for 10 minutes, but they were quick enough to smash our car window and steal a lot of stuff ;) Anyways, I cried for 2 hours. I have these cute pics though ;)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was when I realized how much I love matching suits and business formal attire with a twist! I remember making a Pinterest board just full of colorful pastel matching suits that can be styled a million ways! Still now, everytime I wear this outfit, I always get compliments! Absolutely one of my fave fits ;)

                            After I created my Pinterest board filled with pastel suits, I immediately went searching for these suits on Google. I was torn between this purple suit or the yellow matching suit I saw on ASOS, but after asking my stylist (aka my mom), I went ahead and purchased this.

                            The blazer is an oversized fit that can be paired with a million things! Here, I paired it with a yellow short sleeved turtleneck. It's so comfy and versatile. The pants are of course, wide leg pants and they're also so comfy and soft. They make my legs long lol.

                            This was one of my impulsive buys when COVID was first starting. Everything was on sale and this was one thing I've been eyeing on. And of course, it's yellow hihi. As a short girly, I take every opportunity I get to make myself appear taller lol. That is either through wearing heeled booties or long wide leg pants or both!                      
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I typically pair this with light colored or pastel colored pants. I think this is very fitting during spring season. They're tall enough that it makes your legs look long but also you're still comfortable when wearing them. I get a lot of compliments when I wear them because they definitely brighten out the outfit. Also, who doesn't love sunshine yellow??

                        <p>
                            Fun Fact! I posted this on Instagram and the official Instagram account of H&M actually commented on it asking if they can post it on their social media and other types of media ;) And I got a lot of compliments here too! I wore this outfit the first day of winter quarter of my freshman year. I forced my best friend to take this picture before I go to class lol

                        <p>
                            Around this time, I was kinda leaning towards neutrals especially brown. But I was still experimenting with my outfit color palette. I bought the whole fit online at H&M during winter break as my Christmas present for myself.

                        <p>
                            I fell in love when I saw this! I've always wanted this type of jacket for so long and when I saw that these were on sale, I immediately bought them! They're an oversized fit so they're really comfy and soft. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the jacket is brown, you can pair it with almost anything! The material is really soft and keeps you warm enough. This is perfect when the weather is slightly cold but also not that cold. It definitely fits fall season or the beginning of winter season. If I don't really feel like dressing up, I always just wear this jacket and zip it up and pair it with any pants I'm feeling that day. I think this is such an airport essential too!

                        <p>
                            As you can tell from my previous outfits, I absolutely love wide leg pants. Hence, when I saw these pants on H&M, I knew I had to get one! Also, it's yellow!! Material-wise, they're definitely not one of those stiff and sturdy pants. I think they're made out of cotton so they're stretchy and comfy. They also make my legs look long!                      
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because it's bright yellow, the safest bet is to pair this with more pastel-colored clothes like ones you would wear during spring or summer. The safest color option would definitely be white or a light yellow. However, if you're feeling bold, pair it with brighter and bolder colored clothes like green or purple. I think this is most perfect to wear during summer. I would definitely pair it with a white off the shoulder top (the one from the 2020 fit) and even add a cardigan.

                            This was taken a month ago on my 20th birthday!!! I can't believe I'm 20 years old omg. I actually put this together last minute because I had a class that day so I just wore stuff I haven't worn yet. This is definitely giving me Reputation Era by Taylor Swift with the black color palette. I guess to mark my 20th birthday and "adulthood", I went with more neutral and "adultish" colors which in my opinion is black.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People around me definitely know how much I love color especially my yellow. No one has really seen me in all black. I guess moving on to this new chapter of my life, I wanted to change my style again which is fun! I felt really cool when I wore this! I felt like I'm gonna star in an action movie or like a coming-of-age movie.

                            YES I BOUGHT THIS AT WALMART! It was only like $10 so a really great deal!! Lately, Walmart has been releasing some really good stuff like this one! I actually already bought a lot of things there! Surprisingly, the clothes they sell are also in good quality and really comfy. Hopefully, they last lol

                            You could never go wrong with a black leather jacket. It's a classic! I feel like everyone should at least own one pair of black leather jacket. It definitely is a staple piece and can go with anything! Pair it with black pants and you will definitely look chic!

                            Remember the yellow pants I wore in my 2021 outfit? I loved them so much that I bought another pair in a different color! This is definitely my go-to black pants. They literally go with anything! Oh you have a business formal event? Wear this. You wanna go golfing? Wear this. You have brunch with your friends? Wear this. It literally shape shifts lol.                  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wear this with anything to be honest. But when I want to feel chic and classy, I always pair it with a black turtleneck and black heeled boots and a black beret for a bit of spice! An all black outfit is the easiest way to look classy and put together. They're also so stretchy that you don't have to worry if you've eaten too much at dinner. They'll definitely expand lol! BUY BUY BUY!!  Get them at every color!
