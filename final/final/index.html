                            We took this during the Labor Day weekend back in 2019 when we and a couple of family friends decided to have a weekend getaway around San Jose/San Francisco. We toured outside a couple of tech companies such as Instagram, Facebook, Google. We also went to the San Jose Garden, Santa Cruz Beach and here at Stanford University. I had so much fun that day and took thousands of pictures! I loveeed the campus so much! It's so pretty and the sun was glowing I was obsessed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hands down, this is one of my favorite summer outfits of all time! As you can see, I had a lot of yellow statement pieces so you can probably conclude that I was already obsessed with yellow by then.
                        </p>

                            I actually do not rememeber the time I bought this top but I just know I bought it at the big Walmart. In the recent years, Walmart has some really good and trendy clothes! It fits my body nicely and it's cotton so it's really comfy too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think this top is very versatile! It can be worn during the summer with your favorite pair of jeans. You can also pair it with a nice pastel skirt around the beach. If you want to look more professional, you can pair it with neutral slacks and I personally like to add an oversized blazer.

                            When I was first building my wardrobe, I would always shop at Forever 21 because they have cheap and trendy clothes. I bought this at the Forever 21 right next to Old Teahouse at the University Mall (RIP F21, you will be missed). I remember the store they had over there was soo big that I think one whole room was just shoes and accessories. I love shopping there because it’s so close to home and there was not a lot of people.                     
                        </p>

                            I still wear this pants today and still one of my faves. They’re really comfy and suit with everything. If I’m feeling more a summer vibe, I would pair it with puff shoulder light colored tops. If I’m feeling a little cool, I would pair it with a black turtleneck and leather jacket.

                            This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.

                            Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.

                            This was very first purchase on the ASOS website. I bought it for $24. This was one of those impulsive online shopping purchases. I convinced my dad to buy this for me because there was free shipping and at that time, ASOS rarely does free shipping.

                            This top is perfect for the summer! It’s one of my favorite tops and I always pair it with high waisted wide leg jeans or colorful pants like this one! I had a phase where I would just buy square neck puff sleeve tops because I think they fit me very well.

                            This was very first purchase on the ASOS website. I bought it for $24. This was one of those impulsive online shopping purchases. I convinced my dad to buy this for me because there was free shipping and at that time, ASOS rarely does free shipping.

                            This top is perfect for the summer! It’s one of my favorite tops and I always pair it with high waisted wide leg jeans or colorful pants like this one! I had a phase where I would just buy square neck puff sleeve tops because I think they fit me very well.

                            When I was first building my wardrobe, I would always shop at Forever 21 because they have cheap and trendy clothes. I bought this at the Forever 21 right next to Old Teahouse at the University Mall (RIP F21, you will be missed). I remember the store they had over there was soo big that I think one whole room was just shoes and accessories. I love shopping there because it’s so close to home and there was not a lot of people.

                        <p>
                            I still wear this pants today and still one of my faves. They’re really comfy and suit with everything. If I’m feeling more a summer vibe, I would pair it with puff shoulder light colored tops. If I’m feeling a little cool, I would pair it with a black turtleneck and leather jacket.

                            This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.

                            Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.
