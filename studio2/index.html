                <h1>Sunflower Vol. 6</h1>
                <h2>Sunflower Fields at Woodland, CA</h2>
                <h2>June 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    This was taken around COVID season but around the time when they would let people out as long as we have masks or are isolated. We were touring my brother’s friend from the Philippines around Woodland and Sacramento so we went here to this isolated Sunflower field since it’s close to us and it’s a great place to take pictures. The Sunflowers were HUGE like as big as my face.

                    Around 2020, I quite already know what my style is and started shopping to fit the style that I currently have in mind. I was (and still am) obsessed with yellow so I would have multiple yellow statement pieces that I collected. My love for yellow also resulted my love for sunflower and I still think this is my one of my favorite photos and outfits ever.
